🇵🇱 Poland Population Analysis

📊 Overview

This project explores demographic trends in Poland using historical population data. It provides insights into population growth, density, age structure, and regional trends using data analysis and visualization techniques in Python.



🧰 Tools & Technologies

* Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
* Jupyter Notebook
* NumPy
* CSV datasets


📁 Dataset

* Source: \[Specify the source, e.g., World Bank, Poland Statistics Office, Kaggle, etc.]
